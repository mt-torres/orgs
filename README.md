## :dart: What I've learned
I used Context API to create contexts and remove responsibilities from components, learned how to share information between contexts, reuse hook functions to avoid prop drilling.  
I understood how the Memo hook works, which avoids unnecessary rendering and optimizes the site's performance.  
I also created custom hooks, create routes between pages using react-router-dom library and using elements from the material-ui

## :wrench: Tools
- Visual Studio code
